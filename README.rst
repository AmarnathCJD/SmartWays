SmartWays – Intelligent Traffic Management System
=================================================

SmartWays is an academic mini-project focused on optimizing urban traffic flow
through machine learning techniques and dynamic signal scheduling.

Features
--------

- **ML-Based Congestion Prediction**
  - Utilizes real-time or historical traffic data to estimate congestion levels.

- **Automated Traffic Light Switching**
  - Adjusts signal transitions automatically based on predicted congestion.

- **Priority Round-Robin Scheduling**
  - Ensures fair and efficient lane-wise traffic distribution.

- **Dynamic Quantum Adjustment**
  - Allocates green-signal duration adaptively to match traffic density.

- **Emergency & High-Density Lane Prioritization**
  - Gives priority to critical lanes to reduce delays and prevent bottlenecks.
