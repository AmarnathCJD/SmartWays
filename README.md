### SmartWays

**SmartWays** is a mini-project for intelligent traffic management using machine learning and dynamic scheduling.

#### Features

* ML-based traffic congestion prediction using real-time or historical data
* Automated traffic light switching based on congestion levels
* Priority Round-Robin scheduling algorithm for traffic flow management
* Dynamic quantum (threshold) adjustment to allocate green signal time efficiently
* Prioritization of emergency or high-density lanes for reduced congestion
